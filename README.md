Specific Assignments
Linear Regression Analysis with Fuel Consumption Data ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

In this assignment, you will perform linear regression to analyze the relationship between various features of vehicles and their COâ‚‚ emissions. You'll learn how to:

Load and explore the dataset.
Select features for the analysis.
Train a linear regression model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Visualize the results.
Files:

assignment_linear_regression.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook for the assignment.
FuelConsumption.csv: Dataset used for the analysis.
Steps Involved:

Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data handling and visualization.
Load Data: Load the dataset from a provided URL.
Explore Data: Perform basic data exploration to understand the dataset.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for regression analysis.
Train Model: Train a linear regression model on the selected features.
Evaluate Model: Use metrics like RÂ² score and mean squared error to evaluate the model.
Visualize Results: Plot the results to visualize the fit of the model.
Get Started: Check out the Linear Regression Analysis notebook for step-by-step instructions.
